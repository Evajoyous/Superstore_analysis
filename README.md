### Project Overview
The project sets out to find out what products are performing well in terms of revenue, and the location where these products are doing well. Also, to identify the trends of the product performance over the four years, understand the reason for the underperformance of some segments for a particular period, along with other key findings which are necessary for the store to make better insightful and informed decisions.

### Data Sources

Logistics data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "northwind_data.csv" file, which contains detailed information about the logistics in the company.

### Tools

- Excel (For data cleaning)
- SQL (For data exploration)
- PowerBI (For data visualization)

### Data cleaning
The tasks below were carried out during the data preparation stage:
1. Loading and inspection of data
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Key Findings

1.	For the 4 years, revenue generated was 11.49 million while the profit that came in was 286.40 thousand. The large gap shows that Superstores have very high expenses or operating costs bringing about low profits. Such costs/expenses are likely to include cost of rent, utilities, labor, logistics, and advertisements/marketing.
2. The regional analysis equips the store with the knowledge of which part of the country is performing best in terms of sales and which is the least performing. This helps to direct more concerted marketing efforts in the most profitable areas, as it appears that those are the places that are likely to host a major population of the market.  
3.	Among the total 1849 products, Canon Image Advanced Copier generated the highest amount of sales, yielding 26.54% of the entire sales. At the extreme, the Eureka Disposable bag for Sanitaire Vibra Groomer contributed the lowest to the sales.


### Proposed Recommendations based on the findings

1. To ensure cost optimization and a higher net profit, another analysis of operating costs and expenses should be conducted to identify areas for reduction. Also, a consideration should be made on renegotiating rent, utilities, and labor costs.
2. More marketing efforts and resources should be directed to the Western region, which generates the highest revenue. Also, efforts should be made to expand or strengthen its presence in this region.
A re-evaluation of marketing strategies in the Southern region should be carried out to improve performance.
3.  Consider discontinuing or repositioning low-performing products like the Eureka Disposable bag.
 Invest more in marketing and promoting top-performing products.
4. A review of pricing strategies should be carried out to ensure they are competitive and aligned with market demands
